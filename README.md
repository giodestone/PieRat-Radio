# Playing
[Download Here!](https://github.com/giodestone/PieRat-Radio/releases)

Or alternatively clone the repo and run the files from inside of the 'Executable'.

## Controls
* **W**, **S**, **A**, **D** to steer the ship.
* **Xbox Controller**
    * **Left Stick** to steer;
    * **A** to accelerate.

## How to play
You try to steer the boat close to the houses, so they're in your broadcast range, after some time they will turn red and gain circles. The circles indicate that this household is your fan, and when its red it means that they're listening to you and you're getting money - remember to park next to them from time to time as all those platform shoes add up!

The more houses you gain, the higher your notoriety! The higher your notoriety, the more the fuzz want to catch you - and they are increasingly on the lookout for you. Once you reach maximum notoriety you win!

You also need to manage your fuel, you can pick up yellow barrels (which are scattered around the map) to replenish it. Watch out for the purple ones though - it makes your boat uncontrollable!

There are other pickups too - a golden record (double you income with a sick hit single), a transmission boost (double your range) - both of which can be used to your advantage to beat the fuzz as quickly as possible.
